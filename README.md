# Data Analysis Case Studies using Python

This project demonstrates five small-scale case studies using Python's data analysis and scientific computing libraries: **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. Each case study focuses on a different type of data and showcases analysis, visualization, and basic statistical insights.

## ðŸ“š Case Studies

### ðŸ”¹ Case Study 1: Student Performance Analysis

**Data:** Scores in Math, English, and Science for five students.  
**Operations:**
- Calculate average score for each student.
- Identify the student with the highest total score.
- List students with average scores below 80 (marked for improvement).

### ðŸ”¹ Case Study 2: Sales Trend Analysis

**Data:** Daily sales of Product A and Product B over 5 days.  
**Operations:**
- Compute total sales for each day.
- Identify the day with the highest total sales.
- Plot sales trends over time.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Case Study 3: Matrix Operations

**Data:** Two 3x3 matrices (Matrix A and Matrix B).  
**Operations:**
- Element-wise addition and subtraction.
- Dot product (matrix multiplication).
- Transposition of matrices.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Case Study 4: Employee Data Insights

**Data:** Employee IDs, names, departments, and salaries.  
**Operations:**
- Calculate average salary by department.
- Identify the highest paid employee.
- Compute 10% bonus for each employee.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Case Study 5: Temperature Monitoring

**Data:** Daily temperatures of two cities over 10 days.  
**Operations:**
- Calculate average temperature for each city.
- Find the day with the highest temperature in City A.
- Visualize temperature trends for both cities.
